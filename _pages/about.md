Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a seasoned Data Scientist, with a Master of Mathematics in Computational Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, and 2 years of professional experience. My experiences range from developing machine learning algorithms, architecturing cloud infrastructures to creating insightful dashboards. Check out my work or get in touch - I'd love to connect!

Currently working on extending my master's research project and publishing a research paper.

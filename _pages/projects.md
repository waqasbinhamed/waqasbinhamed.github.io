### Sum-of-norms regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization

Implementation and experimental code for the paper "Sum-of-norms regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization".

The method addresses a fundamental challenge in NMF: automatically determining the correct rank (number of components) without prior knowledge. SONNMF uses sum-of-norms (SON) regularization to encourage pairwise similarity between factor columns, enabling automatic rank discovery by starting with an overestimated rank and reducing it during optimization.

### Nonnegative Unimodal Matrix Factorization

Python implementation of Nonnegative Unimodal Matrix Factorization (NuMF), an NMF method that enforces unimodality constraints. NuMF is particularly useful for applications where the underlying data is expected to have a single peak (unimodal structure) and nonnegative values, such as in signal processing, bioinformatics, and chemometrics.

The implementation is based on the [Nonnegative Unimodal Matrix Factorization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9413349/9413350/09414631.pdf) research paper.

## Professional Projects

*Projects completed during employment where I made key contributions.*

### [SYMX.AI X.Parts](https://symx.ai/product/xparts/)

**Organization:** SYMX.AI (formerly Symboticware)

An NLP system that transforms free-text maintenance logs into structured data, enabling fleet-wide analysis to reduce fuel costs and equipment downtime.

*My Contributions:* Developed the initial proof of concept, evaluated LLM models and selected the appropriate one, curated a domain-specific dataset for training, and built the first extraction algorithm.

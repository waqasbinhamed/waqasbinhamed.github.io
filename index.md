Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a data scientist with 3+ years of experience designing and deploying data analytics and AI driven systems across retail, customer intelligence, and industrial domains. I hold an MMath in Computational Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, and bring expertise across the data science lifecycle — from proof-of-concept to production-ready data and ML products.

## Professional Focus

My work blends research rigor depth with production-grade execution. I specialize in building scalable data and ML systems — ranging from efficient data pipelines to intelligent, real-world AI applications — that drive measurable impact across business functions.

In my role at The Home Depot, I collaborate closely with technical teams and business stakeholders to design and build data systems that support decision-making at scale.

My work spans a variety of projects, including:
- Using GenAI to help optimize SQL workflows and improve data efficiency across teams  
- Building real-time data pipelines that provide performance insights for stores and leadership  
- Developing analytics tools to support workforce planning and operational efficiency  
- Ensuring the reliability of production systems by participating in support and monitoring rotations  


## Research & Technical Interests

I’m drawn to technically complex problems that lie at the intersection of machine learning, applied mathematics, and real-world complexity. My recent work, **Sum-of-norms regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization**, builds on my master’s research in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, with a current preprint under review. I’m especially interested in domains where theoretical methods translate into impactful applications—such as physics-informed ML, scientific computing, and climate modeling.

## Tools & Technologies

I work across the entire data science stack, with tools including:

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash, MATLAB  
- **Data Science and ML/AI**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, Transformers, XGBoost 
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS, GCP, BigQuery, Airflow, Docker, MLOps  

## What Drives Me

I enjoy building intelligent systems that not only solve complex problems, but also scale effectively and make a lasting impact. Whether it’s automating insights, improving decision-making, or deploying robust ML pipelines, I value solutions that are both technically sound and practically relevant.

Feel free to explore my projects or get in touch. I'm always interested in discussing applications of data science and ML in both research and industry.
